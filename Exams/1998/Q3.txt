Entities: Readers, Doccuments, Keywords
Each Reader has a profile consiting of a set of keywords
Each document can be represented by a set of its keywords

Relational Schema:
  Reader(rid#: integer, name:string, email:string)
  Keyword(wid#: integer, word:string)
  Document(did#: integer, url:string, modified:date)
  Interested(reader#:integer, keyword#:integer)
  Contains(document#:integer, keyword#:integer)

a) Write SQL Statements to create Oracle tables for the 
   Reader, Document, and Interested relations.

   create table Reader(
      rid#  integer primary key,
      name  varchar(20)
   );

   create table Document(
      did#  integer primary key,
      url   varchar(50),
      modified  date
   );

   create table Interested(
      reader# integer foreign key references Reader(rid#),
      keyword#  integer foreign key references Keyword(wid#)
   );

b) Write a SQL update statement that changes database to indicate
   that document #35123 was just modified. 

   UPDATE Document
   SET modified = SYSDATE
   WHERE did# = 35123;

c) Write a SQL view that gives all new documents, where new means
   document was modified within last 2 days. 

   CREATE VIEW newDocuments AS
   SELECT * did# FROM Document
   WHERE SYSDATE - modified < 2; 

d) Write a SQL query that finds all new documents that might be
   of interest to reader #197.

   SELECT url FROM newDocuments d, Interested i, Contains c
    WHERE i.reader = #197 and
          i.keyword# = c.keyword# and
          c.document = d.did#;

e) Write a SQL query that finds all pairs of readers that have similar interests,
   where similar interestes mean they share more than three keywords in their 
   profiles.

   SELECT r1.name, r2.name FROM Reader r1, Reader r2
    WHERE r1.rid# < r2.rid# and
      (SELECT count(*) FROM
          ((SELECT keyword# from Interested where reader#=r1.rid#)
            INTERSECT
           (SELECT keyword# from Interested where reader=r2.rid#)
          )
      ) > 3;
